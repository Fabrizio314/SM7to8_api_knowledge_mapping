In Java, there is no direct support for operator overloading, so we need to use a method instead.\\n\\nAmong the provided Java methods, only the first one matches the intended functionality of adding two complex numbers. It is a method named `add` within a `Complex` class that takes another `Complex` object as a parameter and returns a new `Complex` object representing the sum.\\n\\nHowever, the second Java method `add(int a, int b)` does not relate to complex numbers at all but rather adds two integers. The third Java method `add(T a, T b)` is a generic method that adds two numbers of any type extending `Number`, but it is not part of a `Complex` class and thus does not match the intended behavior. The fourth Java method `multiply(double a, double b)` multiplies two doubles and also does not pertain to complex number addition.\\n\\nTherefore, while the first Java method can be used to implement the behavior of the C++ method, the others cannot contribute to this specific functionality. Since the C++ method involves operator overloading and the Java equivalent requires a method call, this indicates a \"one cpp to many java method mapping\" where the Java version needs additional setup (like defining the `Complex` class and its method) compared to the C++ version.

The closest thing is the `finalize()` method, but it is not guaranteed to be called at any specific time and is generally unreliable for resource management.\\n- The `close()` method in the Java `FileHandler` class is intended to be called explicitly by the developer to clean up resources, similar to how a developer would need to call a cleanup function in C++ if no destructor was provided.\\n- The `printMessage()` method does not relate to resource cleanup and thus cannot be part of the implementation.\\n- The `MathUtils.square()` method is unrelated to resource management and file handling.\\n- The `MutableInt` class is also unrelated to resource management and file handling.\\n\\nGiven these points, the Java `close()` method alone comes closest to implementing the behavior of the C++ destructor, but it requires explicit invocation, unlike the C++ destructor which is automatic.

However, there is a mistake in the code: `(a + b) / 2.0` will perform floating-point division because of the `2.0` literal, but the return type is `int`, which means the result will be implicitly cast to an integer, effectively truncating any decimal part. Therefore, the intended behavior seems to be calculating the integer average of two integers.\\n\\n### Java Methods Analysis\\nWe have three Java methods described:\\n1. **add**: Sums two integers.\\n2. **multiply**: Multiplies two double precision floating point numbers or two integers.\\n3. **squareRoot**: Calculates the square root of a number.\\n\\nNone of these methods directly calculate the mean of two integers.

Since the C++ method returns an integer, we need to ensure that the division also results in an integer.\\n\\n### Potential Match\\nTo replicate the behavior of the C++ method, we need to:\\n- Sum the two integers.\\n- Divide the sum by 2 (integer division).\\n\\nThe `add` method can be used to sum the integers.

However, the actual implementation details are not provided, so we assume it would work similarly to the C++ `operator+`.\\n\\n- **Second and Third Candidates**: These candidates deal with adding integers or generic numbers, which doesn\\'t align with the requirement of adding complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts.\\n\\n- **Fourth Candidate**: This candidate deals with multiplication, not addition, so it cannot be used to replicate the behavior of the C++ `operator+`.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe first candidate Java method is the closest match to the C++ `operator+` method for complex numbers. Since the actual implementation details of the `add` method in the `Complex` class are not provided, we assume it behaves similarly to the C++ method.\\n\\n### Structured JSON Output\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"match\": true,\\n  \"java_methods_used\": [\"add\"],\\n  \"api_flow\": [\"add(Complex other) - AND\"],\\n  \"Mapping\": \"one-to-one\",\\n  \"Intent\": \"This method adds two complex numbers together, returning a new complex number with the summed real and imaginary parts.\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this JSON output:\\n- `\"match\": true` indicates that there is a suitable Java method.\\n- `\"java_methods_used\": [\"add\"]` specifies the method that is assumed to be available in the `Complex` class.\\n- `\"api_flow\": [\"add(Complex other) - AND\"]` describes the sequence of methods and their relationship. Here, `AND` implies that the `add` method must be present and correctly implemented in the `Complex` class.\\n- `\"Mapping\": \"one-to-one\"` indicates that the Java method maps directly to the C++ method.\\n- `\"Intent\"` summarizes the intent of the selected Java method, which should replicate the behavior of the C++ `operator+`.', 'refusal': None, 'reasoning': None}}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 561, 'completion_tokens': 718, 'total_tokens': 1279}}\n",

    "    ### Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets think step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1 — Extract behaviour & types:\n",
    "  1.1 Parse the C++ method to extract:\n",
    "      - operation intent (e.g., increment, add, average)\n",
    "      - parameter types (including whether a parameter is a reference '&' or pointer '*')\n",
    "      - return type\n",
    "      - any C++-specific language features used (detect: operator overloading, default arguments, pass-by-reference, pointers, destructors, copy/move semantics, templates, implicit conversions, RAII).\n",
    "  1.2 If a language feature is detected, record it in a list `LanguageFeaturesDetected`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2 — Build type-compatible Java candidate set:\n",
    "  2.1 From list of java methods, select only those Java methods whose signatures and domain types are TYPE-COMPATIBLE with the C++ types (prefer same domain class names and fully matching types). \n",
    "  2.2 If C++ uses a user-defined type (e.g., Complex), exclude Java methods that operate only on unrelated primitives unless an explicit adapter method (e.g., Complex.add(Complex)) exists in the candidates.\n",
    "  2.3 For pass-by-reference: treat candidate Java methods that accept mutable wrappers (e.g., MutableInt, AtomicInteger, IntHolder, int[]) as type-compatible adapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3 — Determine composition & functional equivalence:\n",
    "  3.1 Check if any single candidate method EXACTLY reproduces the C++ behaviour (same effects, side-effects, types). If yes, it is a functional match.\n",
    "  3.2 If no single method, search for combinations of candidate methods that can be composed (sequence or combination) to reproduce the behaviour. Composition is allowed only if parameter/return types and intents are compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4 — Language-feature mapping rule (CRITICAL):\n",
    "  4.1 If `LanguageFeaturesDetected` is non-empty (e.g., pass-by-reference, operator overloading, destructors, default args, pointers, templates), then this is a **Language Feature Translation** and **MUST** be labeled as `\"Mapping\": \"one-to-many\"`, **even if only ONE Java adapter method** from the candidate set is used to simulate the feature.  \n",
    "  4.2 Add `\"MappingCategory\": \"Language Feature Translation\"` to the result whenever any language feature is detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5 — Failure:\n",
    "  5.1 If no single method nor any legal composition of provided candidate methods can exactly reproduce the C++ behaviour, output `\"match\": false` and `\"java_methods_used\": []` with `\"Mapping\": \"none\"` and include `\"LanguageFeaturesDetected\"` if any.\n",

The method performs the following operations:\\n1. Adds the two integers `a` and `b`.\\n2. Divides the sum by `2.0`, which is a double literal, ensuring that the division is performed in floating-point arithmetic to avoid integer division truncation.\\n\\n### Step 2: Determine Java Methods\\n\\nThe provided Java methods are:\\n- `multiply(double, double)`: Multiplies two double numbers.\\n- `divide(double, double)`: Divides two double numbers.\\n- `add(int, int)`: Adds two integers.\\n- `squareRoot(double)`: Computes the square root of a double number.\\n\\n### Step 3: Mapping C++ to Java\\n\\nTo replicate the behavior of the C++ method in Java, we need to:\\n1. Add the two integers using `add(int, int)`.\\n2. Convert the result to a double to ensure floating-point division.\\n3. Divide the sum by `2.0` using `divide(double, double)`.\\n\\n### Step 4: Partial Matches\\n\\nThe `add(int, int)` method can be used to add the two integers. However, since the division must be performed in floating-point arithmetic, we need to cast the result of the addition to a double before using `divide(double, double)`. Unfortunately, there is no direct method for casting in the provided list, but we can assume that the casting can be done in the method implementation.\\n\\n### Step 5: Final Mapping\\n\\nThe Java methods `add(int, int)` and `divide(double, double)` can be used to replicate the behavior of the C++ method. However, since casting is required, this is considered a \"one-to-many\" mapping because it involves more than just method calls.\\n\\n### JSON Output\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"match\": true,\\n  \"java_methods_used\": [\"add(int, int)\", \"divide(double, double)\"],\\n  \"api_flow\": [\"add(int, int) - AND -> divide(double, double)\"],\\n  \"Mapping\": \"one-to-many\",\\n  \"Intent\": \"The Java method \\'add(int, int)\\' is used to add two integers, and the result is cast to a double before being divided by 2.0 using \\'divide(double, double)\\' to compute the mean in floating-point arithmetic.\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON output reflects the analysis and the steps taken to replicate the behavior of the C++ method using the provided Java methods.', 'refusal': None, 'reasoning': None}}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 981, 'completion_tokens': 555, 'total_tokens': 1536, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}}\n",

    "    ### Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets think step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Analyze the behavior and intent of the given C++ method considering its operation like(arithmetic, conditional, looping) and Language Feature Mappings ie all C++ language-level constructs that do not have direct equivalents in Java and must be expressed via one or more explicit Java methods or design patterns like (detect: operator overloading, default arguments, pass-by-reference, pointers, destructors, copy/move semantics, templates, implicit conversions, RAII)\n",
    "Step 2: From the list of java methods provided which has the information about the intent, classname, methodname and method signature.\n",
    "        For each candidate Java method, check if it alone can replicate the behavior of the C++ method, if yes add the signature of that java method to the `java_methods_used` list.\n",
    "        And check all possible combinations of two or more methods. Include all the combinations of methods that fully replicate the behavior of C++ code as method signatures in `java_methods_used` list\n",
    "        The list should be the list of signature of these java methods.\n",
    "Step 3: Form a relationship between the methods from list of methods created from previous steps \n",
    "        - if there is only one function, then flow - signature of that one and only function and realtionship - signature of that one and only function\n",
    "        - if there exist a group of function then check how they replicate the exact C++ behaviour like some function together and some functions alone. \n",
    "            - if we need all the methods combined together to replicate the behaviour then relationship - signature of method 1 AND signature of method 2 AND signature of method 3 AND signature of method 4\n",
    "            - if all the methods can replicate alone then relationship -  signature of method 1 OR signature of method 2 OR signature of method 3 OR signature of method 4\n",
    "            - if some of them replicate alone and some combined together to replicate the exact C++ behaviour then relationship - (signature of method 1) OR (signature of methods 2) OR (signature of method 3 AND signature of method 4)\n",
    "Step 4: From the given c++ code we should check for Language Feature Mappings like overloading and it exists then the mapping is one to many whether it \n",
    "        contains one java method or many java method.\n",
    "        - if the Language Feature Mappings like overloading does not exists on C++ code, and number of methods present in the list is one then mapping is one to one. \n",
    "        - else then mapping is one to many.\n",
    "Step 5: If no combination can fully replicate the behavior, say \"No exact match. skipped\n",

Therefore, the mapping is one-to-many, as the C++ destructor is mapped to a method in Java.\\n\\n5. **Conclusion**:\\n   - The Java method `FileHandler.close()` is the only one that can replicate the behavior of the C++ destructor.', 'refusal': None, 'reasoning': None}}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 1560, 'completion_tokens': 296, 'total_tokens': 1856, 'prompt_tokens_details': None}}\n",
